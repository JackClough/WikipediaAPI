### Wikipedia Births Data Collection Walkthrough
This project collects data on every Wikipedia page for people born in each year over the last 150 years (1866–2015). By the end, you will have a tab-delimited text file listing each person’s name (and optional occupation) alongside their birth year. You can then analyze which birth year has the most Wikipedia entries (“most people”).

### Project Overview
This repository contains a Python script that builds a year‐by‐year list of everyone on Wikipedia born between 1866 and 2015. The main script (“fetch_wikipedia_births.py”) queries Wikipedia’s API for each “Category:<year>_births,” gathers all page titles (optionally splitting out occupations when titles include parentheses), and stores them in memory. Once all 150 years have been fetched, it writes a tab-delimited file (“output_births.txt”) listing each birth year alongside the person’s name (and occupation, if available). Finally, the script identifies which birth year has the largest number of Wikipedia entries and prints that result. No external data files are required—running the script automatically generates the full dataset for analysis.
